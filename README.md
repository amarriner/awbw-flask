# Advance Wars by Web API

*Mostly a learning project. Building a RESTful API with [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.1/) ~~and [SQLAlchemy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/)~~*

No longer using [SQLAlchemy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/). Moving data over to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) instead.
